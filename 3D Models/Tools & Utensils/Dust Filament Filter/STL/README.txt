# Summary

Dog hair, dust, and other small bits might get pushed through your extruder compromising, or completely wrecking a print. After designing a couple filters that were simple slotted cups, I wanted something a bit more refined and lightweight. So I modeled this. Has holes to drop in a bit of oil if need be.

Printed as one piece. Should hinge should be loose or break free with minimal force.

# Print Settings

Printer: i300 Pro
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.16mm
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
3 shells. I printed it in 3DXTech's Red ASA. Print two or more at a time to give the tab a bit more time to cool.

# Post-Printing

I cut two pieces from a kitchen sponge (NOT the cellulose kind) to fit the case. Add a drop or two of oil to help PLA. Not certain if it helps other types.

# How I Designed This

I used Onshape to model it, and then about five prints to get it dialed in.
